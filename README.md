*Zero Noise. Zero Trackers. Zero Nonsense.*  
…because **the web is already loud enough.** 😂

Hey! I’m **Rimon Hossain** — I try to build **precision filter lists** that make your browser behave, your system chill, and your sanity intact.  
From first-party scripts to sneaky trackers, I reclaim control of the web — **intentionally, expertly, and with a hint of sarcasm.** 😎

## 🛠️ My Work

I maintain **RK’s Custom Filter Lists** — curated, hybrid, and layered for real-world web usability:

- 🔹 **ZeroHosts / ZeroDNS** — domain-level protection against ads, trackers, malware, and spam. *No drama, no “oops-I-broke-the-site.”*

- 🔹 **ZeroNoise / AdGhost / ZeroAds** — hybrid rules that remove popups, overlays, forced dialogs, and other annoyances *before they even think of bothering you.*

- 🔹 Focused on **speed, stability, low false positives, and mobile compatibility**. Basically, I break the noise, not your sites.


_Not about blocking everything — only what actually matters. **Unlike that cousin who hoards useless stuff…**_

## ⚡ My Philosophy

- **Precision over aggression**  
- Minimal false positives (*because broken pages are a crime*)  
- Layered filtering: domain-level + hybrid + network  
- Real-world usability, no nonsense  
- Actively maintained, **because procrastination is for amateurs**  

💡 Fun fact: *My filters may cause mild awe, sudden satisfaction, and fewer rage clicks.* 😏

## 🧰 Tools & Platforms

- **Browsers:** uBlock Origin, AdGuard, AdBlock Plus

- **Mobile:** iOS/Android compatible filters  

> I optimize, debug, and pattern-break — all for a **faster, cleaner web experience**.
